# Reading Notes for CodeFellows

This is my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes.

## About me
Hello my name is Spenser, and I am a current student at CodeFellows. I am changing careers to become a code developer in order to gain a better career. I am starting with no coding background, so all of this feels like a foreign language to me. A little about me, I served in the Marines for 10 years. I joined in 2007 to active duty with a MOS (military occupation specialty) 0311 Infantryman. I changed my MOS in 2014 to 0861 Fire Support Man, and went from active duty to the reserves. I just recently left the Marines finishing my last contract in 2020.

### Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is a skill that I feel was instilled in me when I joined the United States Marines. I didn't fully comprehend what it was or even think about a growth mindset compared to a fixed mindset. I learned very early in the Marines that to have a linear thought process is to be stagnant. Marines are always evolving, always adapting to the environment they are in. To stay linear, or to treat every situation the same, to never adapt to the ever-changing environment is the fastest way to lose the fight. One of the many moto's or slogans that Marines live by is
Unofficial US Marines slogan:
> Improvise, Adapt, Overcome

Another example of *Growth Mindset* taught by the Marines is
US Marines:
> ooda loop
> 1. Observe
> 1. Orient
> 1. Decide
> 1. Act
> 1. loop (or start over)

This is a process for reacting to an ever-changing battlespace, or workspace, environment.
