What is git
is the engine under the hood for GitHub
a version control system
lets multiple devs work on same code simo without crashing
keeps a history of my files
allows users to keep trakc change, and revert to previous changes
commit= save as ( to keep track of changes in order to go back in time to previos builds) keeps the same title with save points  to keep track of, like save points in a game
each commit (snapshot) has a label that points to it
HEAD= the label meaning "you are here"
can assign messages to commits
messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot.
make "COMMIT" often. make small changes to my code and save as= "commit"
